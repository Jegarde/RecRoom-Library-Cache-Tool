# Features
- Parse Library cache
- Remove Library cache

# Parsing
The script parses the Library cache file into a readable format. It categorizes every URL by their file extension. (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.room` etc.)
Once done parsing, it exports the parsed library in a `.txt` file. This may change in the future to be easier to work with.
It also displays the file's cache date.
